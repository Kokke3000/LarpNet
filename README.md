# LarpNet (WIP/In development)

LarpNet is a UI-website being developed for a Sci-fi themed larp in 2023, collaborated on by myself and my friend.

## Installation
Quite self-explanatory.

LarpNet should be installed by cloning the files to the root of where your web-server gets it's files from.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on an Apache2 web-server and a MySQL database running on local network. The project can be changed as needed for deployment on other platforms.

Yes, i know the MySQL password and database info are in the files, i know that is not best practice but because the project is designed to never run on a publically accessible server, this isn't an issue.

## Collaborators / Their duties
- Myself: PHP, Javascript, HTML, Server handling
- SupahMonke: CSS, HTML

## Contributing

This is a personal project, no outside pull requests or merges will be accepted. The repo is public only for sharing the code in CV and larp-planning purposes.
