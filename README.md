# LarpNet
LarpNet is a digital user interface website for a Sci-fi themed larp in the summer of 2023.

It is produced by myself and my friend as a personal project.
We are splitting the workload by me doing the main part of the server-side programming and php and my friend doing the CSS and outlook of the website.

The programming languages used for this project are: html, css, php and JavaScript.

The website itself is running on an Apache2 web-server and the user-data is and will be stored in a MySQL database.

This project will most likely not be publically available.
